# What is this?
</div>
An email reminder service.
Whether you want to be reminded in two days, or two years.. you can trust Remindeer!

## Ingredients
* Responsive site / mobile web app
* Homemade anti-spam slider
* Reminders reliably sent out by cron jobs
* Database backed up externally every day


## Method
This was something I personally needed in my life, so I just started working away until it became something usable.
Ideally it'd sent the message by a few methods such as SMS and originally it had an incredible Snapchat option (if I do say so myself!) I'd built, where it created an image containing the text of your message and sent that over Snapchat. They've since removed all the API functionality so, sadly, that had to be removed.


## Conclusions
This taught me a lot about keeping the scope of a project small and achievable (within this surprisingly complicated site) as well as a lot of practice in UI / UX development. Simplicity all the way!


## Pass or Fail?
A strong **pass**.
I've always liked the idea of setting long term reminders letting you know to check standing orders, or that it's the vernal equinox or who knows... that your childhood self would disapprove of your adult life.
With Siri, "Okay Google", etc. you can set notifications but they're not too reliable (in my experience) especially if you lose your phone or account. Remindeer should be golden though, what with being fully backed up every day and the many decades I'll spend maintaining it.
